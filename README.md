# About
	This is a simple rover game which accepts the FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT commands.
    

The Plateau class is configurable in size, being 0 based. In tests I have used 20 and 20 size.

The tests also run a random simulation of landings and check the expected ending position based on 
all possibilities from the initial landing position.

# Run tests
	$ mvn -U clean package
